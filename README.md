## Collections:

The call+ platform enables the collection of loans through digital means. Herein we have the functionality of calling & texting the Loan Account Holders.
The calls made via this can be of two types: Either Inbound or Outbound.

Inbound calls: A list of allocations is uploaded to the dialer service and it starts calling them. The number of threads for calling is determined by the number of agents tagged for Inbound Calling. 
For eg. If only 10 agents are tagged for inbound calling, we can have 15 - 20 active threads for calling.

Outbound calls: Each agent tagged for Outbound is explicitly allocated with loan account holders and a deadline to reach out to all the allocations adhering to the deadlines.

The Outbound calls are made using the same dialer that is used in Inbound calling, just these calls go through a layer. This layer is the Call+ platform.

Call+:
- Enables the management and tagging of agents to the Banks, cycle of allocations, and their hierarchy.
- Defining daily targets of agents by their Team Leaders.
- Performance analysis of the agents and Team Leaders by their reporting supervisors and department heads.
- Bifurcating the allocations, basis their dispositions.
